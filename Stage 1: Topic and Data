Topic and Description: 

Our project will analyze US State demographic data on age distributions to analyze the impact on economic outcomes, specifically the impact on debt-to-GDP ratios. 


Motivation:

We suspect that there is a significant relationship between the proportion of the older population and the state debt to GDP ratio. Given a relatively greater proportion of older population, state and local politicians will be incentivized to enact policies to cater to that demographic, which disproportionately benefits from state benefits in retirement while contributing relatively less in tax revenue due to greater retirement rates. 

Research Question:
(Descriptive) Does having a disproportionately young or old population correlate with the debt-to-GDP ratio of a state?
(Causal) Is there a causal impact of having a relatively older population on state debt-to-GDP ratios? 
Specifically through older populations receiving greater benefits from the state while contributing less in retirement than their younger counterparts.
Potentially look at spending on pensions etc.
(Predictive) Can we use changes in age demographics to predict financial well-being of states?
